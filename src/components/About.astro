      <p class="text-xl text-gray-100/80 leading-relaxed">
        We're a small team building open-source tools focused on filling people's needs, not our bank accounts.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-100">Our Philosophy</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-100/75 leading-relaxed">
          We believe software should remain free, transparent, and accessible to
          everyone. That's why all our projects fall under the AGPL-3.0 license,
          ensuring they stay open source forever. We give you full control over
          your data because it belongs to you.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-100/75 leading-relaxed">
          Our team brings together developers worldwide to build solutions that benefit everyone. We're not just
          creating software, we're building a community that drives innovation through shared knowledge.
        </p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-100">What We Do</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-100/75 leading-relaxed">
          Obiente, unlike other corporate companies, wants to prioritize users
          over profits. We build SaaS applications that are completely
          free to use and powered by our community. From distributed monitoring
          systems to UI component libraries, our projects solve things we actually need
          without hidden costs or vendor lock-in.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-100/75 leading-relaxed">
          Every tool we create is designed with transparency at its core. You
          can see exactly how it works, modify it for your needs, and contribute
          improvements back to the community. This isn't just about code, it's
          about building trust through openness.

          <blockquote class="text-gray-100/60 italic leading-relaxed space-y-4">
            <p>
              "I got frustrated seeing so many tools that are way too expensive
              for what they offer. Built for maximum profit rather than to
              actually benefit the end user. They lock you in with minimal
              features and charge premium prices for basic functionality."
            </p>
            <p>
              "That's why I started Obiente. We needed a better alternative to all the big corporate software that drains your wallet.
              Sure, there's usually a free option for everything, but they're often incomplete or missing key features. That's the gap I want to fill."

        <p class="text-gray-100/75 leading-relaxed">
          This frustration with overpriced, feature-limited tools led to
          Obiente's core mission: creating sustainable alternatives that
          actually serve users instead of shareholders. We've seen too many
          promising tools disappear or become inaccessible when companies pivot
          or get acquired.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-100/75 leading-relaxed">
          Our goal is simple: build software that remains free and
          belongs to the people using it. Every project we create starts with something
          people need, not a market opportunity. That's how
          we ensure we're building things that actually matter.

          We believe your data belongs to you - always. Unlike companies that
          harvest and monetize user data, we collect only what's necessary to
          deliver our services and give you complete control over it.

              All anonymized usage data is published publicly so the community
              can analyze and improve our tools together. We believe in radical
              transparency: if we're collecting it, you should be able to see
              it and understand why.
