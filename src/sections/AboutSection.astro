          <Typography variant="body">
            Unlike corporate companies, we want to prioritize our users
            rather than profits. We build software and tools that are completely free to
            use and powered by our community. From distributed monitoring
            systems to UI component libraries, our projects solve things we
            actually need without hidden costs or vendor lock-in.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body">
            Every tool we create is designed with transparency at its core. You
            can see exactly how it works, modify it for your needs, and
            contribute improvements back to the community. This isn't just about
            code, it's about building trust through openness.

              "I got frustrated seeing so many tools that are way too expensive
              for what they offer. Built for maximum profit rather than to
              actually benefit the end user. They lock you in with minimal
              features and charge premium prices for basic functionality."

              "That's why I started Obiente. We needed a better alternative to
              all the big corporate software that drains your wallet. Sure,
              there's usually a free option for everything, but they're often
              incomplete or missing key features. That's the gap I want to
              fill."

            This frustration with overpriced, feature-limited tools led to
            Obiente's core mission: creating sustainable alternatives that
            actually serve users instead of shareholders. We've seen too many
            promising tools disappear or become inaccessible when companies
            pivot or get acquired.

            Our goal is simple: build software that remains free and belongs to
            the people using it. Every project we create starts with something
            people need, not a market opportunity. That's how we ensure we're
            building things that actually matter.

            We believe software should remain free, transparent, and accessible
            to everyone. That's why all our projects fall under the AGPL-3.0
            license, ensuring they stay open source forever. We give you full
            control over your data because it belongs to you.

            building a community that drives innovation through shared
            knowledge.
